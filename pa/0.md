# PA0: Intro. to Pyret

**Due**: Saturday, Aug 28 at 11:59pm.

## Part 0: A Tour of Pyret

Read [A Tour of Pyret](https://www.pyret.org/docs/latest/A_Tour_of_Pyret.html), which introduces the basic datatypes and control flow operators of the Pyret language. Other documentation you may find useful is linked here and on the main course page:
* [Language Concepts](https://www.pyret.org/docs/latest/Language_Concepts.html)
* [Libraries](https://www.pyret.org/docs/latest/Builtins_and_Libraries.html)

## Part 1: "Install Pyret"

Pyret is implemented in JavaScript and runs entirely online so there's not that much to install, really. But note that to save programs in the Pyret editor, you will need to sign up for a Google account if you don't already have one.

To test that things work, go to:

[https://code.pyret.org](https://code.pyret.org),

click the "Open Editor" button, then type the following program into the left-hand window:

```
print("Hello, Pyret!")
```

After hitting the "Run" button, you should see the following output in the right-hand window:

```
Hello, Pyret!
"Hello, Pyret!"
```

TROUBLESHOOTING: You may find that the Pyret editor works better in Google Chrome than in older versions of Firefox. It seems to work fine in Microsoft Edge and in new Firefoxes.

It *is* possible to use your own editor (e.g., vscode, vim, emacs) with the command-line Pyret compiler, however you will receive limited support from myself or the TA if something goes wrong. See [here](https://www.pyret.org/set-sail/) for instructions.

## Part 2: Complete the Exercises

* Download [./pa0.arr](pa0.arr) and copy/paste it into a new Pyret editor window.
* Complete the exercises as directed in the comments in the file, making sure that you include your name and Ohio ID.
* Make sure that, before you submit, all test cases pass (or as many as you can make pass). You can check how many tests are currently passing by hitting the "Run" button.
* Submit your file, named pa0.arr, via Blackboard on or before 11:59pm on the due date.
